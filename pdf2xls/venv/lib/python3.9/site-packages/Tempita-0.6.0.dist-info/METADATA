Tempita is a small templating language for text substitution.

This isn't meant to be the Next Big Thing in templating; it's just a
handy little templating language for when your project outgrows
``string.Template`` or ``%`` substitution.  It's small, it embeds
Python in strings, and it doesn't do much else.

You can read about the Language and the Interface at
https://github.com/TurboGears/tempita/blob/main/README.rst,
and there's nothing more to learn about it.
